summary: |
  The authors provided all material and documented the process well, the check was therefore straightforward. Due to long computation times, only a subset of the results could be checked. Reproducing the results in the repository was successful, with non-significant numerical discrepancies. However, a small number of minor differences with the results in the arXiv preprint merit clarification.
